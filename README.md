# Project Idea: Task Management API
---
# Description: 
- Create a RESTful API for managing tasks, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The API should also include authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the endpoints.
---
# Features to Include:
- User Authentication: Implement user registration and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users should be able to sign up, log in, and receive a token for subsequent API requests.
---
# Task CRUD Operations: 
- Create APIs to perform CRUD operations on tasks. Users should be able to create new tasks, retrieve a list of tasks, update existing tasks, and delete tasks.
---
# Task Filtering and Sorting: 
- Implement endpoints to filter and sort tasks based on various criteria, such as task status, priority, due date, or assignee.
---
# User Roles and Permissions: 
- Include role-based authorization, allowing different users to have different levels of access and permissions to tasks. For example, only the task creator or assigned user can update or delete a task.
---
# User Profile: 
- Create APIs for users to view and update their profiles, including features like changing passwords or updating personal information.
---
# Error Handling and Validation: 
- Implement proper error handling and validation of request data to provide meaningful error messages and maintain data integrity.
---
# Pagination and Limiting: 
- Include pagination support in the API responses to limit the number of tasks returned per request and enable users to navigate through larger sets of data.
---
# API Documentation: 
- Generate comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman to describe the endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
---
# Testing and Deployment: 
- Write unit tests for critical functionalities and deploy the API to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS for demonstration purposes.
---
# Logging and Monitoring: 
- Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track API usage, detect errors, and monitor performance metrics.
